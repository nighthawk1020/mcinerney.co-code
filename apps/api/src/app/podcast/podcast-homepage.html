    <h1>Nomsters Podcast</h1>
    <p>There's nothing better in this world than the sloppy mess of a good burger. 
      Us nomsters have sacrificed our arteries for the greatest good of finding the best burger in the world (by world we mostly mean NYC). 
      Join Ben, Darius, and Mike to hear about their delicious adventures and awful jokes. 
      Burgers come first in our hearts and minds, but we also dabble in ridiculous food news. </p>
